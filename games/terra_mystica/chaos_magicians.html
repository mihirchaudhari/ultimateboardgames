			<h1>Original Strategy</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>I am going to use Chaos Magicians, why? Because I like their flavor text the best.</p>
			<p>Now the hard part, how can we maximize the potential of Chaos Magicians</p>
			<p>First off, some tips about the game which I learned from my first run</p>
			<p>At the beginning, workers are needed, and coins are needed at the end game</p>
			<p>
				Now we can start going into the strategy in more detail. Let's start by analyzing the Chaos Magician
				faction. The initial resources don't look too good. Four workers put us already at a slight disadvantage
				from the competition. 15 coins and two tracks on the Fire Cult is looking pretty average. Power is also
				pretty average, 7 in the second bowl and 5 in the first bowl. Our stronghold gives us two workers (nice) and
				a really cool power. During each round, we get to take a double turn. I will talk about how this double turn
				should be utilized later. Our ability is insane-ly good for everyone else. We start with one dwelling and we
				go last (after Nomads place third dwelling). With so many weaknesses, what is our strength except for the double
				turn. I ask you to look at the sanctuary and temples. We get two favor tiles instead of one, and this is huge.
				Now, let's talk about how we should play this game.
			</p>
			<p>
				When placing the dwelling, one obvious weakness can be seen, it will be harder for us to unlock keys. Because of this,
				I will reccommend to do good in the cult tracks, not be the best. You should get one town, two if you are good, so definetly
				go for the fire track. If we do some quick maths here, if you place first in all 8, you get 32 points, which is a heck ton. But,
				you will also have to expend a lot of resources for this, so I reccommend going for fire and air or earth depending on which favor
				tiles you choose (get to that as well later). This way, you will get 24 points. Get at least four on each one, so you can get end
				of round bonuses, but you have to decide wether it's worth it depending on the reward, because you have to focus on other things as well.
				You also need to maximize the amount of points that you earn during each round, so keep this in mind during your turns. You want to build
				to go for that huge bonus at the end of the game, so most of the planning has to be done at the beginning. There are two good spots on the map,
				and they are red tiles adjacent to gray and yellow. There are two of these, and you will be really lucky if both of them are free, if they are not,
				either choose one and fight, or try something else. You want to be near other people so you can get the extra power. The Trading post price decrease
				is nice, but you are mainly going for power. Don't be crazy for it, do it most of the times when it is beneficial. You want to get the power actions
				before the other players, but you also want to expand at the very beginning. To do this, you can't be cycling 12 power, that's too much. The 6 power
				for double spades is too exspensive in my opinion, so let's look at the most exspensive one, which is actually 4. Don't reduce all your power down
				to four, it would actually be a better idea to go for a number like 6, so you can sacrifice some later if needed. Power will be used a lot for
				getting workers, and decreasing the cost of terraforming to one sounds good at first, but you probably won't actually be terraforming that much. If
				the situation calls for it, then go for it, but I will reccommend going for it at least once, but only early game, since it will greatly reduce the
				total amount of workers you will use. Now I should start talking about one of the more challenging parts of the game, selecting bonus cards. For one,
				they are bonus cards so look at the bonus they provide, and not the resource they provide because it is unreliable. Spade is legendary at the beginning,
				and coins can be very good at the late game. But you should also try to go for points as much as possible, because the goal is to get all the points.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now that we have a general plan, let us talk about first turn strategies. We want to make use of the double favor, so we have to rush temple. This will
				also give us an early priest advangtage, and you can use it on anything. You need to look at the other players, will they get priests? If they will, use
				it on the cult track, otherwise, you should use it for shipping, if you will build across the river, or to decrease spade cost, if you need to terraform
				a lot. If you get the spade, then use it to terraform and build a dwelling, so you will be less behind the other players (don't worry about nomads,
				they start out ahead). Whenever you pick up a favor tile, DO NOT CHOOSE THREE CULT INFLUENCE, IT IS TRASH AND BAD AND YOU WILL REGRET DOING IT. Now,
				we should definetly take advangtage of our double favor tile and go for a two cult one, and a one cult one. At the beginning, I suggest 1 power and 1
				worker to continue catching up, and get an early 3 points per trading post. For the second temple, I reccommend four power and dwelling. You will
				definetly feel like you are rushing the first round, and that is because you are, and it is vital the catch up and make a comeback. Build your
				sanctuary end game because you don't really need it when you can build temples for cheaper. After two temples, try to increase shipping and continue
				expanding. You don't really need to use the stronghold, unless there are very specific cirsumstances, such as advancing the cult track. Try to build
				many dwellings so you can obtain those elusive workers.

			<h1>Analysis</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>So what went wrong?</p>
			<p>Mr. Wang is better than me, and much more</p>
			<p>
				One of the biggest weaknesses of Chaos Magicians is that they can easily be trapped in, if everyone knows what they are doing. Luckilly for me, only Mr.
				Wang knew what he was doing. But that's not something I can control. I would say that there were two things that I did wrong. I got decimated in the
				cult track by ignoring it and I discarded too much power.
			</p>
			<h1>Reworked Strategy</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				The first part of the game is choosing a starting location, and this is super important. You have to build near people so you can save some gold, but
				you must also be careful about getting trapped in, because you basically lost if you do. I would choose an area where you can terraform at least one tile
				for one shovel, and where you are next to a river. You will need to get shipping, because this is the best way to "run" away from everyone else, while you
				build your structures.
			</p>
			<img src="/ultimateboardgames/images/terra_mystica/strategies/chaos_magicians/bonus_tiles.jpg" class="left">
			<p>
				The next part of the game is what you should rush on the first turn. The game is too variable after the first turn, so you will need to do certain actions
				to react to other actions, but you should do certain set moves on the first turn, when using any faction. The stronghold is nice, because you can take two
				moves. This is only useful for spending priests on the cult track, so there isn't really too much of a good use for it, so you can ignore it for most situations.
				The strength in Chaos Magicians lies in their power to take two favor tiles instead of one when building a temple. This is insane and can put you in a huge
				advantage compared to other players. While most factions get a maximum of 5 favor tiles, you can get up to 10 favor tiles. So we will have to rush temple.
				This will also give us a bishop early, so we can invest in the shipping track. You start off with 5 workers and 15 gold. It takes 4 workers and 8 gold to
				upgrade your initial dwelling to a church. The next things to talk about is power. You should sacrifice a total of 3-5 power in the beginning of the game,
				so you can sacrifice the rest end game for a desperate power action or to convert into gold at the end. Twelve is too much power and four is too less power.
				The power action you should take depends on other factors. Your bonus tile is also an important factor on the first turn. Always take shovel if you can. If
				the shovel bonus tile is taken, take one of these reccommended ones (in order of reccommendation). 3 power and worker, priest, shippping and power, coins.
				If all do not appear or are taken, choose shipping and power or cult and money. If you get shovel, build a dwelling first. You then need money because you
				will only have 5 gold left, and that's not enough. If you get any power bonus tile, sacrifice 4 power to get a free shovel, and build a dwelling. You are
				desperate to build this dwelling because it will make you caught up with everyone else, and provide worker income, which is a shortage you will have early game
				if you aren't careful. If you get a priest, use a power action (when you get the power) to decrease shovel cost. You will have two coins left with this route.
			</p>
			<img src="/ultimateboardgames/images/terra_mystica/strategies/chaos_magicians/favor_tiles.PNG" class="right">
			<p>
				Before talking abot general gameplan, favor tiles should be discussed next. First, take the dwelling favor and power and worker favors. You will need to build
				dwellings on round two to increase workers to continue building dwellings on round three (this will change based on round bonuses). How many points will this give
				us? Let's assume that we got a priest and the cuurent and next round bonuses are dwelling bonuses. We get four points per dwelling with our favor, but how mnay dwellings
				can we get? At the end of round 1, we have 0 workers, two coins, 8 total power and all of it is in bowl I. Assume you take the 6 gold bonus tile, and also took the one power
				and one worker favor tile. Then you will have two workers, 8 coins, 1 priest, 7 power in bowl I and one power in bowl II. You also have 26 victory points. On your next turn, you terraform an adjacent tile and build a dwelling, so you have one worker and two coins left. Now you
				have 32 points. Your friends are behind, so you are able to get a total of 8 power this turn, and now have 25 victory points, but now you have 7 power in bowl I and one power in
				bowl III. You then put sent a priest to the fire cult, and move up three spots, which gives you three power in the process, and you now have 4 power in bowl III. You use that power to get
				two more workers, and now you have 3 workers and 2 coins. You build a dwelling on your next turn, which gives you  4 more points, but you are now out of coins, and have three workers.
				At the end of the round, you have 2 workers, 0 coins, 0 priests, 29 points, and the bonus gets you at 7 power in bowl II. You get 4 workers now because of the new open spots and one power
				gets moved to bowl III. You also took a power worker favor tile, so  you now have 7 workers, 0 coins, 1 priest, and 3 power in bowl II and 4 power in bowl III. You use the power action
				to get 7 coins. You terraform two spots, and build a dwelling on one without having to terraform. You have one coin left but built three dwellings, so you got 12 points, which puts
				you at 41 points. Now you have plently of workers and stall out that turn. That was a good comeback on the second round, because now you just need to worry about money. Let's
				calculate the trading posts one a bit faster and more hypothetical, since we weren't even taking into consideration opponent moves. The maximum number of times you can upgrade
				to trading posts is 8 times, and you can get a maximum of 6 points for each, so 42 points possible. If you also have 4 trading posts and the right bonus tile, you will get
				8 more points, so 50 points. With the favor, it is bumped to 54. It can go higher than this depending on what round you can get this done. The main things is to look for ways to score
				points other than the finals round, and choose favor tiles based on that.
				Next, you should take the trading post and 4 power. We are basically getting a way to get income and a way to get points. Depending on how good you are doing, you should get either
				6 power town or trading post bonus when you pass, and then get a three cult track favor tile. Your next two should be cult influences. Originally, I said do not
				take these. That was when I was using cultists, and did not realize how useful these could be.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, there is the general plan. You want to build dwellings early on to get workers, and mostly use power actions to get money, so you have to act fast.
				Make the most out of round bonuses. Also choose favor tiles that correspond with what you are doing to get points, or get the coin one if you need coins. If
				you know you are going to build a lot of dwellings, get the dewllings bonus tile, and same with trading post. You will probably not win the largest area, so
				try to get some points of it, but invest in the second end of round bonus. Escaping from being trapped in is the number one priority, so get shipping track early,
				but you should also do great on the cult tracks. If you win all cult tracks, one final bonus, and get third on one bonus, you get 48 points. If you can maximize
				trading posts, let's say you get 50 points from it. If you also get 1 shipping and 1 shovel reduce price, it is 8 more points. That is 106 points right there,
				so you need to figure out how to get the resources to get these points while fighting the other players. Good luck, and abuse power (using matematatics).
