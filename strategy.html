	<p>I am going to use Chaos Magicians, why? Because I like their flavor text the best.</p>
	<p>Now the hard part, how can we maximize the potential of Chaos Magicians</p>
	<p>First off, some tips about the game which I learned from my first run</p>
	<p>At the beginning, workers are needed, and coins are needed at the end game</p>
	<p>
		Now we can start going into the strategy in more detail. Let's start by analyzing the Chaos Magician
		faction. The initial resources don't look too good. Four workers put us already at a slight disadvantage
		from the competition. 15 coins and two tracks on the Fire Cult is looking pretty average. Power is also
		pretty average, 7 in the second bowl and 5 in the first bowl. Our stronghold gives us two workers (nice) and
		a really cool power. During each round, we get to take a double turn. I will talk about how this double turn
		should be utilized later. Our ability is insane-ly good for everyone else. We start with one dwelling and we
		go last (after Nomads place third dwelling). With so many weaknesses, what is our strength except for the double
		turn. I ask you to look at the sanctuary and temples. We get two favor tiles instead of one, and this is huge.
		Now, let's talk about how we should play this game.

		When placing the dwelling, one obvious weakness can be seen, it will be harder for us to unlock keys. Because of this,
		I will reccommend to do good in the cult tracks, not be the best. You should get one town, two if you are good, so definetly
		go for the fire track. If we do some quick maths here, if you place first in all 8, you get 32 points, which is a heck ton. But,
		you will also have to expend a lot of resources for this, so I reccommend going for fire and air or earth depending on which favor
		tiles you choose (get to that as well later). This way, you will get 24 points. Get at least four on each one, so you can get end
		of round bonuses, but you have to decide wether it's worth it depending on the reward, because you have to focus on other things as well.
		You also need to maximize the amount of points that you earn during each round, so keep this in mind during your turns. You want to build
		to go for that huge bonus at the end of the game, so most of the planning has to be done at the beginning. There are two good spots on the map,
		and they are red tiles adjacent to gray and yellow. There are two of these, and you will be really lucky if both of them are free, if they are not,
		either choose one and fight, or try something else. You want to be near other people so you can get the extra power. The Trading post price decrease
		is nice, but you are mainly going for power. Don't be crazy for it, do it most of the times when it is beneficial. You want to get the power actions
		before the other players, but you also want to expand at the very beginning. To do this, you can't be cycling 12 power, that's too much. The 6 power
		for double spades is too exspensive in my opinion, so let's look at the most exspensive one, which is actually 4. Don't reduce all your power down
		to four, it would actually be a better idea to go for a number like 6, so you can sacrifice some later if needed. Power will be used a lot for
		getting workers, and decreasing the cost of terraforming to one sounds good at first, but you probably won't actually be terraforming that much. If
		the situation calls for it, then go for it, but I will reccommend going for it at least once, but only early game, since it will greatly reduce the
		total amount of workers you will use. Now I should start talking about one of the more challenging parts of the game, selecting bonus cards. For one,
		they are bonus cards so look at the bonus they provide, and not the resource they provide because it is unreliable. Spade is legendary at the beginning,
		and coins can be very good at the late game. But you should also try to go for points as much as possible, because the goal is to get all the points.

		Now that we have a general plan, let us talk about first turn strategies. We want to make use of the double favor, so we have to rush temple. This will
		also give us an early priest advangtage, and you can use it on anything. You need to look at the other players, will they get priests? If they will, use
		it on the cult track, otherwise, you should use it for shipping, if you will build across the river, or to decrease spade cost, if you need to terraform
		a lot. If you get the spade, then use it to terraform and build a dwelling, so you will be less behind the other players (don't worry about nomads,
		they start out ahead). Whenever you pick up a favor tile, DO NOT CHOOSE THREE CULT INFLUENCE, IT IS TRASH AND BAD AND YOU WILL REGRET DOING IT. Now,
		we should definetly take advangtage of our double favor tile and go for a two cult one, and a one cult one. At the beginning, I suggest 1 power and 1
		worker to continue catching up, and get an early 3 points per trading post. For the second temple, I reccommend four power and dwelling. You will
		definetly feel like you are rushing the first round, and that is because you are, and it is vital the catch up and make a comeback. Build your
		sanctuary end game because you don't really need it when you can build temples for cheaper. After two temples, try to increase shipping and continue
		expanding. You don't really need to use the stronghold, unless there are very specific cirsumstances, such as advancing the cult track. Try to build
		many dwellings so you can obtain those elusive workers.
